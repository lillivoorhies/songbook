			Trouble in mind, I'm blue
			My poor heart is healing slow
			I've never had such trouble in my whole life before

			I'm gonna lay my head
			On some lonesome railroad line
			And let that 2:19 special ease my troubled mind

			Trouble in mind, I'm blue,

			Or stood by a river where nothing was flowing
			If you've seen a red rose unkissed by the dew

			While the sand slipped through the opening
			And their hands reached for the golden ring
			With their hearts they turned to each other's hearts for refuge
			In the troubled years that came before the deluge

			Some of them knew pleasure
			And some of them knew pain
			And for some of them it was only the moment that mattered
			And on the brave and crazy wings of youth
			They went flying around in the rain
			And their feathers, once so fine, grew torn and tattered
			And in the end they traded their tired wings
			For the resignation that living brings
			And exchanged love's bright and fragile glow
			For the glitter and the rouge
			And in a moment they were swept before the deluge
			
			Let the music keep our spirits high
			Let the buildings keep our children dry
			Let creation reveal its secrets by and by, by and by
			When the light that's lost within us reaches the sky
			
			Some of them were angry
			At the way the earth was abused
			By the men who learned how to forge her beauty into power
			And they struggled to protect her from them
			Only to be confused
			By the magnitude of her fury in the final hour
			And when the sand was gone and the time arrived
			In the naked dawn only a few survived
			And in attempts to understand a thing so simple and so huge
			Believed that they were meant to live after the deluge

			And I fell in love with a Creole girl,

			I said, "My pretty Creole girl,
			My money here's no good,

			I'd sleep out in the wood".
			"You're welcome here kind stranger,
			Our house is very plain.
			But we never turn a stranger out,
			From the lakes of Pontchartrain."
			
			She took me into her mammy's house,

			To try and paint her beauty,

			I never will see you no more,
			But I'll ne'er forget your kindness
			In the cottage by the shore.
			And at each social gathering
			A flowing glass I'll raise,
			And I'll drink a health to my Creole girl,

			You were always dancing in and out of view
			I must've always thought you'd be around
			Always keeping things real by playing the clown
			Now you're nowhere to be found

			I don't know what happens when people die
			Can't seem to grasp it as hard as I try
			It's like a song playing right in my ear
			That I can't sing
			I can't help listening

			I can't help feeling stupid standing 'round
			Crying as they ease you down
			Cause I know that you'd rather we were dancing
			Dancing our sorrow away
			(Right on dancing)
			No matter what fate chooses to play
			(There's nothing you can do about it anyway)

			Just do the steps that you've been shown
			By everyone you've ever known
			Until the dance becomes your very own
			No matter how close to yours another's steps have grown
			In the end there is one dance you'll do alone

			Keep a fire for the human race
			And let your prayers go drifting into space
			You never know will be coming down

			Perhaps a better world is drawing near
			And just as easily, it could all disappear
			Along with whatever meaning you might have found
			Don't let the uncertainty turn you around
			(The world keeps turning around and around)
			Go on and make a joyful sound

			Into a dancer you have grown
			From a seed somebody else has thrown
			Go on ahead and throw some seeds of your own
			And somewhere between the time you arrive and the time you go
			May lie a reason you were alive but you'll never know

			One morning, one morning, one morning in May

			Said the soldier to the lady, "Oh where are you going?"
			"Just down by the orchard, just down by the tree"
			"Just down by the orchard, just down by the tree"
			"To see the waters gliding and the nightingale sing"
			
			They had not been there an hour or two
			'Til from his satchel a fiddle he drew
			He played a message that made the hills ring
			"Hark hark," said the lady, "hear the nightingale sing"
			
			Said the lady to the soldier, "Will you marry me?"

			I was nineteen when I came to town
			They called in the Summer of Love
			They were burningbabies, burning flags
			The Hawks against the Doves

			I took a job in the Steamie
			Down on Cauldrum Street
			I fell in love with a laundry girl
			Was working next to me

			She was a rare thing
			Fine as a beeswing
			So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
			She was a lost child
			She was running wild, she said
			As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
			And you wouldn't want me any other way

			Brown hair zig-zag round her face
			And a look of half-surprise
			Like a fox caught in the headlights
			There was an animal in her eyes

			She said, young man, O can't you see
			I'm not the factory kind
			If you don't take me out of here
			I'll surely lose my miind

			She was a rare thing
			Fine as a beeswing
			So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
			She was a lost child
			She was running wild, she said
			As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
			And you wouldn't want me any other way

			We busked around the market towns
			And picked fruit down in Kent
			And we could tinker lamps and pots
			And knives wherever we went

			And I said that we might settle down
			Get a few acres dug
			Fire burning in the hearth
			And babies on the rug

			She said O man, you foolish man
			It surely sounds like hell
			You might be lord of half the world
			You'll not own me as well

			She was a rare thing
			Fine as a beeswing
			So fine a breath of wind might blow her away
			She was a lost child
			She was running wild, she said
			As long as there's no price on love, I'll stay
			And you wouldn't want me any other way

			We was camping down the Gower one time
			The work was pretty good
			She thought we shouldn't wait for frost
			And I thought maybe we should

			We were drinking more in those days
			And tempers reached a pitch
			Like a fool I let her run
			With the rambling itch

			Last I hear she's sleeping out
			Back on Derby beat
			White Horse in her hip pocket
			And a wolfhound at her feet

			And they say she even married once
			A man named Romany Brown
			But even a Gypsy caravan
			Was too much settliing down

			And they say her flower is faded now
			Hard weather and hard booze
			But maybe that's just the price you pay
			For the chains you refuse

			She was a rare thing
			Fine as a beeswing
			And I missher more than ever words could say
			If I could just taste
			All of her wildness now
			If I could hold her in my arms today
			Then I wouldn't want her any other way

			If you got a woman you better treat her just as good as you can

			There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me 
			There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me 
			Never have seen a river that's too wide
			There ain’t no jail tight enough to lock me
			There ain’t no man big enough to stop me
			I’ll be there if you ever want me by your side
			
			So love me if you ever gonna love me 
			I never have seen a road to rough to ride
			There ain't no chains strong enough to hold me
			There ain't no breeze big enough to slow me
			I'll be there if you ever want me by your side
					
			There ain't no rope tight enough to bind me
			Look for me honey you will find me 
			Any old time your ready with your charm
			I'll be there ready and a waiting
			There won't be any hesitation
			I'll be there if you ever want me in your arms

			When I was a child my family would travel
			Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born
			And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered
			So many times that my memories are worn

			And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
			Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
			Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
			Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
			
			Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River
			To the abandoned old prison down by Airdrie Hill
			Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols
			But empty pop bottles was all we would kill
			
			And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
			Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
			Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
			Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
			
			Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel
			And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land
			Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken
			Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man
			
			And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
			Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
			Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
			Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away
			
			When I die let my ashes float down the Green River
			Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam
			I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'
			Just five miles away from wherever I am
			
			And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County
			Down by the Green River where Paradise lay
			Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking
			Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

			We had an apartment in the city
			Me and Loretta liked living there
			Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown
			A life of their own left us alone
			John and Linda live in Omaha
			And Joe is somewhere on the road
			We lost Davy in the Korean war
			And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore

			Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger
			And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day
			Old people just grow lonesome
			Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"

			Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more
			She sits and stares through the back door screen
			And all the news just repeats itself
			Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen
			Someday I'll go and call up Rudy
			We worked together at the factory
			But what could I say if asks "What's new?"
			"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do"

			So if you're walking down the street sometime
			And spot some hollow ancient eyes
			Please don't just pass 'em by and stare
			As if you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello"
